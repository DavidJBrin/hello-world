# hello-world
The requisite starting repository for organizing and managing initial projects.
From here, I will be branching out into other projects, organizing my learning with Udemy as well as my learning with UDACITY and Google during my time completing the Udacity Google Challenge Scholarship.
I have 20 years of operations management experience in restaurants, and about as many years writing. In the last few years I've operated in a freelance capacity as a blog/web content contributor. I'm hoping to expand into web and mobile application development to expand my available services to freelance clients.
